## Overview

Your Admin tool controls the heart and soul of your website: How you configure your menus, ordering, and home screen are how you present your restaurant to customers - and you should have full control over that. Build your website at your own pace on
this user-friendly interface. Check out the descriptions, screenshots, and videos below to learn more!

## The Dashboard

On a successful login, the dashboard is the first thing you see. Get weekly revenue, order, and average sale price statistics at a glance with the dashboard top bar. Look below on desktop and scroll down on a mobile screen to get analytical charts on orders, revenue, and food and beverage consumption. These are helpful to make business decisions based off what sells, and what flops with your customers. Additionally, the progress of any personal order/revenue goals will be displayed on this screen.
